Emojifier

```bash
pip3 install --user emoji

ln -s $OLDPWD/emojifier.py .

I must confess, I love emojis ðŸ¤¦! And when I was chatting on IRC I really missed them... This plugin will let you use emojis on hexchat. It has a basic emoji autompleter and no more doc than that for now. PRs are welcomed
